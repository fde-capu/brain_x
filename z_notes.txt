v.
types of action (op):
 * defaults

 - threshold above
 - threshold below

 	opt(A) spark  || value* || discr			|| multi			|| leaks		||
 	       1      || value  || abs(thres - val)	|| multiply by tr	|| thres value 	||

 	opt(B)	accu*				|| disp		|| bias		|| axon
 			accumulate value	|| wastes	|| noise	|| treat tr as

 	opt(C) divide bus for each out || same bus for each out
 	opt		clip* || acc+1 || op?

 - axon = threshold multiply

 - gradative leak
 	(leak from bz/tr proportion increasinly) 
 - regressive leak
 	(leak from bz/tr proportion diminishing) 
 - ducking
 	(after tr, tr goes 0 and gradually increases) 
 - reverb
 	(always sum fraction of previous out)
 - delay
 	(remember past steps and repeat in cicles, decreasinly)
 - equalizer
 	(filter bands)

types of reduction (re):
 - sum_clip : no reduction, only sum until 1
 - sigmoid
 
 Bias behaviors:
 - random / static / waveshape
 - continuous / granular
 - ADSR
 - local / global / selective

 Autoresponse:
 - For every action, a feedback input in self
