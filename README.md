### original concept for a Deep Learning machine

This is a very personal project made with passion.

Inspired (though absolutelly not *ipsis-litteris*) by this rather neat paper "Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies": http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf

It aims to emulate a deep neural genetic evolution network in a transparent way.

It is fully authoral, that is, no references for industry-standards and protocols on the area.

This is a first write of an Artificial Intelligence structure. It is a study, not meant to be functional in principle. It is purposefully slow.

Please refer to the source files for in-depth interpretation of the many abstractions involved. Though the code is not commented, it is hopefully understandable.

This was a creative vacation project, just a *take* on the subject by that time it was developed. Whenever there is time left inside my brain, I dream of deep learning models. This is one of them.
